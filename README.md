# Ultrasonic Distance Sensor

Arduino sketch that reads distance from an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and prints it in cm to the Serial Monitor.

## Wiring

| HC-SR04 | Arduino |
|---------|---------|
| VCC     | 5V      |
| GND     | GND     |
| TRIG    | D5      |
| ECHO    | D6      |

## Usage

1. Wire up the sensor.
2. Upload the sketch.
3. Open the Serial Monitor at 9600 baud.

The sketch averages 5 readings and prints `Out of range / no echo` if nothing is detected. Works from about 2 cm to 400 cm.
